# Introduction
These are the typed up solutions to textbooks I have worked through.
I am using it primarily to help me learn LaTeX / TikZ / related tools and to increase my accountability to do some math.
This project was partially inspired by the "Project Crazy Project," where a heroic student was trying to amass a complete set of solutions to "Abstract Algebra" by Dummit & Foote. 

## Book List
