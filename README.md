# Introduction
These are the typed up solutions to textbooks I have worked through.

I am using it primarily to help me learn LaTeX / TikZ / other tools and to increase my accountability to do some math & computer science/programming.

This project was partially inspired by the "Project Crazy Project," (an extinct project) where a heroic student was trying to amass a complete set of solutions to "Abstract Algebra" by Dummit & Foote.

## Book List
### Introduction to Graph Theory - Richard J. Trudeau
  * Chapter 7 is presently omitted: I was quite unhappy with this chapter and will look for a better treatment elsewhere. Additionally, a bunch of the exercises wanted sketches of graphs on tori which I am not yet capable of in TikZ

### Conceptual Mathematics - Lawvere & Schanuel
  * Through chapter 30.

## Errors, Omissions, Etc.
These notes are primarily for my own benefit, but if any egregious errors are found please feel free to open an issue or pull request and we can try to get it straightened out. I apologize in advance for any silly mistakes or typos, but I am less likely to be interested in fixing those at this time.

I have omitted problems where I deem fit. That is, I may have judged that typing the problem up would have been too time consuming, or the answers were given in the text, or they were just boring problems, or... (some other excuse).
