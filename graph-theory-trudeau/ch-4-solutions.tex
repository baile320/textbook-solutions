\begin{enumerate}

	\item[1] $N_1$ is certainly planar, and we proved that it is connected. Prove now that it is polygonal by proving that the statement ``every edge of $N_1$ borders on two different faces" is true.
	
	\textbf{Solution:} This is vacuously true because there are no edges in $N_1$.
	
	\item[2] Omitted. There are many lengthy discussions about fake induction proofs online.
	
	\item[3] Believe it or not, the graph of Figure 104a is planar. Find its number of faces.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: $v = 9$, $e = 20$, so $v + f - e = 2 \implies f = 13$
	
	\item[4] Imitate the proof of Corollary 12 to construct a proof that the graph in 104b is nonplanar.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: Suppose it is planar. By inspection, the figure is not a supergraph of $K_3$, so by Theorem 12, we have $e \leq 2v - 4$. But, inspecting the graph, we see that $v = 8$ and $e = 16$ which implies $16 \leq 12$, a contradiction. Therefore, it must not be planar.
	
	\item[5] Find a polygonal graph G having a face bordering the infinite face which, if removed, results in a subgraph H which is not polygonal.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: Removing the face determined by $(2, 3, 5, 4)$ below would leave us with a graph that is not polygonal, since it would be disconnected.

                		edge node [right] {} (5)

				(5)	edge node [right] {} (6);

	\item[6] Prove this partial converse to Euler's formula: If a graph is planar and $v + f - e = 2$, then the graph is connected.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: Suppose the graph is not connected but is planar. Then we can apply Euler's formula to both pieces and get $v_1 + f_1 - e_1 = 2$ and $v_2 + f_2 - e_2 = 2$. Notice that $v = v_1 + v_2$ and $e = e_1 + e_2$ and $f + 1= f_1 + f_2$ (because we double-counted the infinite face). Therefore, we get $v + f - e = v_1 + f_1 - e_1 + v_2 + f_2 - e_2 + 1 = 4 \implies v + f - e = 3$. But, this is a contradiction by Euler's formula, so the graph must have been connected.
	
	\item[7] Let `p' denote the number of components of a graph and prove this generalization of Euler's formula: if a graph is planar, then $v + f - e = 1 + p$.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: We proceed by induction on $p$. We already know that the case $p = 1$ is true because that is just the familiar Euler's formula. Suppose for a graph with $n$ components we have $v + f - e = 1 + n$. Now, given any graph $G$ with $n + 1$ components we can reduce this to a graph $H$ with $n$ components by adding an edge connecting one component to another, which would not change the number of vertices or faces. Therefore, we have $v_H + f_H - e_H = 1 + (n + 1) \iff v_H + f_H - (e_G + 1) = 1 + (n + 1) \iff v_G + f_G - e_G = 1 + n$, which completes the inductive step to complete the proof.
	
	\textbf{Alternative Solution}: We could instead treat each component as its own graph and apply Euler's formula to each piece. Suppose we have $n$ components. Then we have $\sum_{i}{v_i} + \sum_{i}{f_i} + \sum_{i}{e_i} = 2$. Summing over all $n$ components we have $V + \sum_{i}{f_i} - E = 2n$ but doing it this way we accidentally counted the infinite face $n$ times in total, so we should have $V + \sum_{i}{f_i} - E - (n - 1) = 2n \implies V + F - E = 1 + n$

	\item[8] Use corollary 13 to show the graph in Figure 106 is nonplanar:
	
	\textbf{Solution}: Every vertex has degree 6, so by corollary 13, it cannot be planar.
