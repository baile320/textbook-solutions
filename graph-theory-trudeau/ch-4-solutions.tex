\begin{enumerate}

	\item[1] $N_1$ is certainly planar, and we proved that it is connected. Prove now that it is polygonal by proving that the statement ``every edge of $N_1$ borders on two different faces" is true.
	
	\textbf{Solution:} This is vacuously true because there are no edges in $N_1$.
	
	\item[2] Omitted. There are many lengthy discussions about fake induction proofs online.
	
	\item[3] Believe it or not, the graph of Figure 104a is planar. Find its number of faces.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: $v = 9$, $e = 20$, so $v + f - e = 2 \implies f = 13$
	
	\item[4] Imitate the proof of Corollary 12 to construct a proof that the graph in 104b is nonplanar.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: Suppose it is planar. By inspection, the figure is not a supergraph of $K_3$, so by Theorem 12, we have $e \leq 2v - 4$. But, inspecting the graph, we see that $v = 8$ and $e = 16$ which implies $16 \leq 12$, a contradiction. Therefore, it must not be planar.
	
	\item[5] Find a polygonal graph G having a face bordering the infinite face which, if removed, results in a subgraph H which is not polygonal.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: Removing the face determined by $(2, 3, 5, 4)$ below would leave us with a graph that is not polygonal, since it would be disconnected.

	\item[6] Prove this partial converse to Euler's formula: If a graph is planar and $v + f - e = 2$, then the graph is connected.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: We proceed by induction on $f$. In the case $f = 1$, we have $G = N_1$ which is connected (see problem 4.1). Now, suppose a graph with $n$ faces is planar, has $v + f - e = 2$, and is connected. Given a planar graph $G$ with $n + 1$ faces

	\item[7] Let `p' denote the number of components of a graph and prove this generalization of Euler's formula: if a graph is planar, then $v + f - e = 1 + p$.
	
	\textbf{Solution}: We proceed by induction on $p$. We already know that the case $p = 1$ is true because that is just the familiar Euler's formula. Suppose for a graph with $n$ components we have $v + f - e = 1 + n$. Now, given any graph $G$ with $n + 1$ components we can reduce this to a graph $H$ with $n$ components by adding an edge connecting one component to another, which would not change the number of vertices or faces. Therefore, we have $v_H + f_H - e_H = 1 + (n + 1) \iff v_H + f_H - (e_G + 1) = 1 + (n + 1) \iff v_G + f_G - e_G = 1 + n$, which completes the inductive step to complete the proof.
