\begin{enumerate}

	\item[1] $N_1$ is certainly planar, and we proved that it is connected. Prove now that it is polygonal by proving that the statement ``every edge of $N_1$ borders on two different faces" is true.
	
	\textbf{Solution:} This is vacuously true because there are no edges in $N_1$.
	
	\item[2] Omitted. There are many lengthy discussions about fake induction proofs online.
	
	\item[3] Believe it or not, the graph of Figure 104a is planar. Find its number of faces.
