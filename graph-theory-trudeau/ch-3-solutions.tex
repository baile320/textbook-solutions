\begin{enumerate}
	\item[1] Prove the following statements:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[a] If 3 edges were added to the graph in Figure 63a, then at least 2 of the new edges will be adjacent.
		\item[b] Every graph with $v = 5$ and $e = 3$ has at least two adjacent edges.
		\item[c] If $v$ is an odd number, then every graph with $v$ vertices and $\frac{1}{2}(v + 1)$ edges has at least two adjacent edges.
	\end{enumerate}
