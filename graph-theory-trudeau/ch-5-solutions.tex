	\begin{enumerate}

		\item[1] Draw all connected graphs that are regular of degree 1.
		
		\textbf{Solution}: There's just one connected graph of degree one: two vertices connected to each other.
		
		\item[2] Satisfy yourself that every connected graph which is regular of degree 2 is a cyclic graph. Show by example that deleting the word ``connected" results in a false statement.
		
		\textbf{Solution}: An example is a graph that has multiple disconnected cyclic graphs.
